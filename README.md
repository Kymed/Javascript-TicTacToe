Javascript Tic Tac Toe Application Developed by Kyle Meade.

Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

First mini web app to practice using Javascript.

Simply open up index.html and play! 

Features:

- 1v1 mode

- Play against computer (Ai mode)

- Computer can prevent player wins, detect it's own possible wins, and is still possible to beat. Used some for loop math to simplify these algorithms.

- Will prompt player turns and winner!

- Can switch modes after every game
